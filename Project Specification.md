# MEAN-based web app

# _Team 1, for INF397 Full Stack Technologies_

## Project Description

We will build a full stack web application using **Node.js** , **AngularJS** , **Express.js** and **MongoDB**. We will start with an authorization template and work from there.

The name of our app will be **Best Cars** and will show off many interesting features utilized in real-world web applications. Users will be able to register and add pictures of their cars. The data is going to be saved into the database and all the cars added will be shown in the front page of the app with the ability to like and comment them. We will also have a section which we could see only the cars added only by the user.

We will be using Javascript on both the frontend and backend. And by using MongoDB which is a NoSQL database, we are able to make use of familiar JSON syntax. We will definitely use NPM modules in order to accomplish some of the expected functionalities.

## Team members:

Edor Kacerja

Momchil Chernev

Erdoan Muca

Endri Ndini

## Related expertise

We have middle level expertise in front-end and little to no experience in back-end. No experience with NoSQl databases.

## Development &amp; Agile methodology

We will try to use SCRUM development, in this way we will divide the labor and tasks and set up weekly goals for our team members to complete.

## Architecture

## User management

We will use a password authentication model. We will hard-code the users at first. Later we can store them in some database.

## Data management

We will store the data in a NoSQL database, MongoDB.

## Security

The application will be insecure.

## Hardest problem

The hardest problem is that we are going to use latest technologies which we have not personally used before. So we will be learning and coding at the same time.

## Do we need to solve this problem first?

No,  we believe we can learn by doing.

## Technologies

We will use AngularJS, Node.js, Express and MongoDB, NPM, Bower.
